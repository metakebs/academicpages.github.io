## DAILY LOGS

### 2021-03-16 (TUE)  
* completed PSE Fib Level calculator
* testing for Intra-day Screening and Execution
    * data update during 1H
    * 30m TF check (partially based on 'Optimal') 

#### $ PRIM
    * TF: 30m
    * Setup: MMC1
    * Target: 2.9 (adjusted Tamad Fib)

### 2021-03-17 (WED)  
* Workflow test
    1. EOD Screening (1D TF, 75% Trank)
    2. Intra Screening (30m TF, 80% Trank)
        * Captures 15m and 30m optimal, not too fast

### 2021-03-18 (THU)
* Test Workflow
    1. EOD/Stocks monitored on TF-1d
        * Potential buy signals could be on TF-2h?
    2. Intra/Stocks monitored on TF-30m
        * Personally, 30m is convinent TF
        * Could be switched to TF-15m for buy signals depending on volatility

    > TF switch is still confusing, which TF to deploy/use signal?
    > Could be bullish in one TF and bearish on the other?
    > Should Risk/Reward or upside be considered? vs Volatility?
    > **CASE1:**
    > Buy signal on TF-15m, where to check exit signals? Exit signals on TF-15m could be too fast. Go to hihger TF?
    > 
    > **CASE2:**
    > If you are buying on TF-30m, you could set a trail stop related to volatility (w/in expected volatility on that TF?), this protects your gains, while being also protected from premature exits which could be signalled if you look on lower time frame instead (e.g. TF-15m)

### 2021-03-19 (FRI)
* Theory 1 (Entry Points)
    1. Higher TF (eg 1D + medium volatility):
        1. Find Potential Trend Reversal
        2. Find Ongoing Trends
    2. Lower TF (eg 30m):
        1. Find entry based on momentum
    3. For volatile stocks (long candles, high volatility)
        1. "Higher" TF could be 2h/30m, "Lower" TF could be 15m/5m
        2. Look for optimal TF

* Entry being missed
    * Stoch cross-up below CHOP
        > needs to find conviction/confirmation if this is true 
        
### 2021-03-23 (TUE)
**TF ideally depends on volatility**

LOW TF (minutes)
* volatile stocks monitored here, where trends are recognizable
* for non-volatile stocks, the entry/exit margin could be too small

HIGH TF (hours/days)
* volatile stocks could show up as single candle with long body or long wick
* volatile stocks would have very wide entry and exit ranges (difficult to execute)
* volatile stocks prone to whiplash
* non-volatile, entry are more manageable, margins are larger as well

> **Volatility** *inversely proportional* **TF**

**Computing optimal TF?**
1. Expected candle movement is 1%-2%, allowing at least 3 candles to form before cutting.

### 2021-03-24 (WED)
* No trades, slow market

### 2021-03-25 (THU)
> 1. Check of Stoch direction on other TF for confluence?
> 2. Stoch reversal on TF-1d could that are far from bias cross could have buy signals on lower TF?
> 3. Yesterday's low Tranks and low Vola could be tomorrow's top trade/gain?

### 2021-04-07 (WED)
#### $PRMX
    * TF: 15m
    * Setup: retrace, UC
    * Exit: ALMA15 b/d
    Late exit, should have exited on high (how to estimate?)

### 2021-04-13 (TUE)
#### $ACEN
> Instinct: Sell at 7.8 due to recent rally (sell on strength)
> Did not sell, expecting bounce is tighter
> **!! Wrong Call !!**
> Lesson: set a trail stop? possible exit @ **MA50 break on 15m**

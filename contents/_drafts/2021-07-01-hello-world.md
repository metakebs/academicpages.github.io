I'm officially launching this personal site today! :tada: 

# Why?

I have been contemplating on starting a blog for some time now, mainly to share my _unsolicited_ thoughts on things that interests me. 

_"Why not just post it on facebook?"_ 

Well, old people really tend to outgrow social networking sites, and sadly I may reached that age already.

Also, more importantly, I want to have a place to curate my photography portfolio _that is not Instagram_. I'd like it to be a place where the viewer could take their time to see what they like, and not somewhere they're subconsciously forced to scroll down after a few seconds. I do have an instagram though, so feel free to visit and follow :joy:

# Jekyll

Last year, I was so close to setting up a website using wordpress, and then using Adobe portfolio, mainly for my photographs. It was really easy to use with a lot of available templates, but at a certain point you really hit a ceiling on how much you can customize. I was satisfied with the platform already actually, and the real reason I wasn't able to launch it was the lack of content, and the continuous push back of the upload of most photos (too lazy to curate them) :joy:

`insert screenshot of supposed site`

Anyway, fast forward to present, I decided to use jekyll instead. It's a static site generator that gives you more control on a lot of things, at the same time already handling a lot of the back-end stuff so you don't need to build a site from scratch.  This was the perfect solution given that I also fell in love using markdown for most of my note-taking purposes.  `insert links to jekyll and markdown`

Right now I'm using a theme called `academic pages`, one that is arguably very minimal and . I like how it's very minimal and lightweight, but later on I do plan to explore more on the design space. I'm very much looking forward to revisit my graphic design , at the same time learn more backend stuff with jekyll.

# What to expect?

I do have some broad strokes in mind on what to fill this space with:

- photography portfolio
- coding and data science projects
- blog posts

It's too general and all over the place right now, but as I come up with more content hopefully things become more coherent.

**Welcome to my kitchen!**
------
I'll introduce myself as _metakebs_, though I don't think my real name's that hard to guess. Thanks for visiting my personal site!

I'm not sure what compelled you to wander off to this low-traffic wilderness of the internet, but since you're already here I hope you enjoy the hodgepodge of my collective interests! 

Feel free to join me as I curate the things I dabble in, and experience the randomness, the rawness, and the diversity of it all. Hopefully, you can find some delight (and value!) from this hot mess lol.

**What's on the menu?**
------
Nothing much, really. I usually focus on serving the following stuff:
* thoughts on anything
* pretentious film reviews 
* reflections on losing trades
* data science attempts
* photography portfolio
* graphic design portfolio
* etc

But the icing on this regrettable cake: expect some generous amount of bad humor, no extra charge! Consider yourself warned! :fire:

**Welcome to my personal site!**
------
I'll introduce myself as _metakebs_, though I don't think my real name's that hard to guess. 

I'm not sure what compelled you to wander off to this low-traffic wilderness of the internet, but since you're already here I hope you enjoy the hodgepodge of my collective interests! 

Experience the full glory of its randomness, the harsh competing flavors, and the rare surprising harmonies of the things I do and explore. Hopefully, you can pick up some delight (and value!) from my ramblings. :joy:

**Menu**
------
I'll be serving _ample_ amounts of the following stuff:
* reviews (of whatever)
* bad trades
* photography
* graphic design
* data science attempts
* anything else

To top it off, expect some copious amounts of bad humor too, no extra charge! Consider yourself warned! :laugh:

**Welcome to my personal site!**
------
I'd introduce myself as `metakebs`, though my real name's probably too obvious. I'm not sure what compelled you to wander off to this low-traffic portion of the internet, but since you're already here I hope you enjoy the hodgepodge of my collective interests. The randomness, the harshly competing flavors, and the surprising harmonies -- whatever that may come out of this ungodly mixture, I still hope you find some delight (and value!) from it!

**Menu**
------
I'll be serving _ample_ amounts of the following stuff:
* reviews (of whatever)
* bad trades
* photography
* graphic design
* data science attempts
* anything else

To top it off, maybe I'll pair it off with copious amounts of bad humor too. Consider yourself warned!
